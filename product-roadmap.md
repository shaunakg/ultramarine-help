# Ultramarine Product Roadmap

We continuously improve this product with the latest updates and security improvements. On this page are some goals that we would like to achieve in Ultramarine.

## Goals
- Sending images
- Finer control of message length - currently the server truncates too-long messages which leads to decryption errors.
- Better persistance and control of usernames
- Option to not send the flag in messages
- Option to encrypt username in messages
- Storage of password for chatrooms client-side
